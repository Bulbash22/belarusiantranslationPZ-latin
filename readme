Belarusian latin script (be-tarask) translation files for Project Zomboid
===========
NOTA BENE:
These translations try to follow belarusian grammar described here: (https://knihi.com/storage/pravapis2005.html).
These translations are not professional - you may encounter some mistakes.
The quality of translations may vary due to the time-span during which they were made - translations, that were made at the start MAY be bad or even blatantly wrong (MAY does not necessarily mean that they WILL).
If you don't understand why certain words were chosen -
These translations try to rely on non-Krapiva-like dictionaries and non-russian words.
So if you see an unfamiliar word - try researching it in the recommended dictionaries, archives and other translations beforehand.
Before deleting or changing anything try to understand why it was put there in the first place.
On some VERY RARE occasions you may encounter neologisms - they were used in places, where the traditional boundaries of the language ended.
Feel free to replace these neologisms if you know traditional belarusian words that they can be replaced with.
The use of dialectal words is encouraged if it diversifies and improves the overall quality of the translation.
